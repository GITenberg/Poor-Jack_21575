description: In nineteenth-century parlance, a poor jack" is a waterfront urchin,
  which is how we meet sailor's son Thomas Saunders in Greenwich, England. Swept into
  the English Channel with his friend Bramble, he survives imprisonment in France,
  eventually making his fortune as a Thames River pilot. Marryat also paints a realistic
  portrait of contemporary home life.
